# What is GIMPixel?

GIMPixel is a set of brushes, palettes, and image templates designed to turn GIMP into an enjoyable piece of pixeling software. It's still in its infancy, so if you know a thing or two about configuring GIMP or would like to contribute brushes, palettes, or more, don't hesitate to join in!

## Usage
To use GIMPixel, you must run GIMP after changing the "GIMP2_DIRECTORY" environment variable. To do so, just run something like `GIMP2_DIRECTORY=.gimpixel gimp` and it should work without messing with your existing GIMP configuration.
